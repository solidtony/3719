\section{Introduction}

Of the four fundamental forces of nature, gravity is the one that we have the 
most experience with in our everyday lives.  It is such a constant in our lives 
that every movement we make factors in the force of gravity, even if we are not
aware of it. We put objects down, expecting them to stay there because of 
gravity. A basketball player shoots a ball upwards, expecting the familiar 
parabolic arc due to gravity to bring it back down into the basket.  Even the
common phenomenon known as walking relies on gravity's pull to give our feet
the friction needed to push us forward. Our experience with gravity is so
intimate that we know exactly how things perform in earth's gravity field 
without having to measure and calculate (e.g. the basketball player knowing the 
right momentum to give the ball to score a basket without any calculation being
performed).

\g\ as a measure of force of gravity...

Importance of calculating g:  study mantle, earthquakes?, earth's density 
(similar to recent lunar probes), clock timing (which use pendula as well)...

To calculate \g, we will use a pendulum setup quite similar to that of the
pendulum clocks mentioned above.  Section~\ref{sec:theory} will introduce the 
physics behind this calculation more thoroughly.  Here we state the intended 
goals of our study of the motion of a simple pendulum:  (1) To be able to 
determine the value of \g, which as discussed above is an important parameter
for a variety of calculations; (2) to test a mathematical model (introduced in 
section~\ref{sec:theory}) of a physical system and compare the correspondence 
between the two and (3) use the process as an introduction into the sources of 
errors and their propagation to gain greater skills as a physicist-in-training. 
The experiment we will be performing is discussed in great detail in ..........

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

\subsection{Setup}

The setup consisted of a metal frame attached to a wall, a string, and a metal 
ball.

\subsection{Procedure}

The first measurements we made were those of the ball diameter and the length 
of the hook on the top of the ball.  These data are contained in table \#\#\#\#\#. 
These measurements were made using ???\#\#\#a vernier caliper.  Due to the size of 
the ball and the large uncertainty associated with measuring the full length 
from the pivot point to the ball center (the center of mass of the
ball) we decided it would be best to measure the length of the string from the
pivot point to the top of the hook of the ball and then add the measured values 
for the hook height and ball radius afterwards.  The uncertainties from the 
caliper measurements are small enough compared to the uncertainty in using 
either a measuring stick or a tape measure in determining the length of the
string that making three separate measurements like this do not create an 
unnecessarily large uncertainty in length.  As stated above, a tape measure 
and/or measuring stick were used to measure the distance from the pivot point
to the top of the hook.  This was the distance that was measured when the
pendulum length was varied.

The next step was to determine the uncertainty of the stopwatch we used.  The
stopwatches we used were brand \#\#\#\#\#.  There were two sources of systematic 
uncertainty in the time measurements made by the stopwatch.  The first was the 
gain/lag the stopwatch had over real time.  The second was simply the finite 
gradations of time measured by the stopwatch ($.01 s$).  To account for the 
first source of systematic error (and also to determine which of the two 
authors were most accurate and precise in their time measurements) we timed 
ourselves against an atomic clock for 1s and 100s intervals.  (On the second
day, 20s and 50s intervals).  These data are available in table \fillin.  JW 
was determined to have the best combination of accuracy and precision and was 
designated as the official timekeeper for the duration of the study.  As seen 
in table \fillin, the mean of the time measurements were not equal to the time 
interval attempted to be measured.  This gain/lag were accounted for in our 
final results by finding the what percentage of the real, atomic clock time 
was the gain/lag time.  To find this percentage we used the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:timeweight}
P=\frac{t_{atomic}-t_{mean}}{t_{atomic}} 
\end{equation}

where $P$ is the percentage, $t_{atomic}$ is the real time as measured by the 
atomic clock 
and $t_{mean}$ is the mean of the times measured by the 
stopwatch.  This percentage was multiplied by all the \T\ we measured to give
the error from the gain/lag of the stopwatch.

Measuring against the atomic clock provided a measure of both the stopwatch's 
own limitations and the user's reaction time.  However, it is impossible to 
separate the two.  In order to fully account for the user's reaction time the 
above error was assumed to be due entirely to the stopwatch's limitations and 
a separate calculation was made of the timekeeper's reaction time.  The 
timekeeper recorded himself pushing the start and stop button on the stopwatch 
as fast as possible.  The data from this exercise are recorded in table \fillin. 
The average was $.17s$; this number was added to the overall uncertainty of $T$. 

The next thing we did was determine the best way to measure the period of the 
pendulum's swing, i.e., a method that would allow us to both be accurate 
(allowing us to obtain a true value for \g) and precise (thus reducing random 
error). We first compared whether it was better to start timing a period from 
when the ball was released or to wait a period and start timing with the 
second period.  We wanted to see if there was a difference in accuracy and 
precision between the simultaneous double hand movement of releasing the ball 
while starting the stopwatch and just timing the period by eye. For this we 
timed a single swing of the pendulum eight times for both cases (i.e. starting 
timing with the swing and starting timing with the second swing) this was done 
for two different lengths: one around $26cm$ and the other around \fillin$cm$. 
These data are shown in table \fillin. Unfortunately the method with the lowest 
mean (timing from release) had the largest spread in times measured and 
vice-versa (for timing the second period). We chose to go 
with the method with the least uncertainty (i.e. lowest spread, or timing the 
second swing) over greatest accuracy because we figured that the method we 
used to determine the stopwatch gain/lag was closest to the method that timed 
the second swing; for both methods, the start and stop time were determined by 
eye.  If we had pushed a button on the atomic clock to start its timing at the 
same moment we had started the stopwatch, then this method would have been 
more similar to the method that used the release time of the pendulum to 
measure \T.  Therefore, the weighting factor determined by the timing against 
the atomic clock method factors in the inaccuracy of the second method more 
than the first method (in addition to the stopwatch's own gain/lag). The 
inaccuracy of the second method being thus accounted for we are free to choose..... 

We then measured the period of 20 oscillations (starting from the second 
swing) five separate times. We refer to this as $T_{20}$. The purpose of this 
measurement was to reduce the error in determining the period.  Since 
$T=\frac{T_{20}}{20}$ it follows that
\begin{equation}
\delta_T = \frac{\delta_{T20}}{20}.  Derive this later
\end{equation}
Thus, measuring 20 periods allows us to reduce the error in \T\ by a factor of 
$20$.  Since measuring 20 periods is not more difficult or significantly more 
time consuming than just measuring one period, this provides a relatively easy 
way to reduce the uncertainty in \T.  After measuring \Ttwen\ five times we 
found the mean, the standard deviation, and the standard deviation of the 
mean.  As will be shown in section~\ref{sec:data}, five was a good number of trials to 
choose to reduce the random uncertainty to values comparable to the systematic 
uncertainties without having to perform the experiment and unnecessarily large 
number of times. {\bf We must show this!!!!}  The length of the string was 
then increased to about \fillin $cm$ and the above process was repeated (i.e., 
timing the first period, timing the second period, timing 20 periods).
